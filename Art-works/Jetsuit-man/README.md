# Jet Suit man 

Who doesn't desire to fly in the sky like birds?. The freedom to go anywhere without any resrtictions. Well thanks to modern day inventions it is possible for us humans to fly high in the sky. <br>
This art is just a demonstration of how a jet suit works. Not accurate enough but just tried my bit. The aim in making this pen was to implement CSS animation properties.
